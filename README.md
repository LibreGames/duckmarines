DuckMarines
==========

DuckMarines (working title) is a cross-platform free software remake of Sonic Team's Chu Chu Rocket for the Sega Dreamcast.

Chu Chu Rocket is an amazing party game but few people own a Dreamcast these days.
DuckMarines try to recreate the magic of the original game's multiplayer on the PC.

DuckMarines will feature entirely new assets (sprites, music etc.) and gameplay changes that we find appropriate, while still staying true to the original.
